# Content marketing

At Sourcegraph, we define **content marketing** as generating awareness, building trust, and nurturing our relationship with the developer community and enterprise buyers by providing interesting, relevant, and valuable content. This definition explains why we create content and who we create it for.

**Content strategy** dives a layer deeper to include the governance and operations of content: how we generate, validate, and approve ideas; how we ensure quality and consistency; where we distribute content; how we measure performance; and how we update, revise, and retire content.

## Purpose, mission, and vision

Our purpose, mission, and vision explain why we create, who we create it for, and what we strive to achieve.

**Purpose:** Inspire and advocate for better developer experiences.

**Mission:** Educate the market on the risks of poor developer experiences (ex: Big Code) and the benefits of effective development environments (ex: universal code search).

**Vision:** Become the most trusted branded resource
covering the developer experience.


## Content principles

These are the principles that guide all content creation at Sourcegraph. 

1. **Quality over quantity.** We do not sacrifice quality for quantity, and we take our reputation as a content producing company seriously. We respect our audiences’ time and thus, we respect the creative process and allow ample time for content creation. 
1. **Audience-first mentality.** We prioritize the needs of our audience over our own. Our content offers useful and actionable information regardless of whether the reader uses Sourcegraph or not. Content marketing does not equal advertising. 
1. **Keep it helpful and simple.** We make it easy to find, consume, and share our content. We create content that is intelligent, thoughtful, and accessible to all and apply user experience best practices. We don’t engage in fear mongering or share vapid content.

### Values alignment

How our content strategy aligns with our company values.

| Value      | Content alignment |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Be customer driven      | Our content serves our customers’ interests first. We focus on providing valuable information to our audiences over pitching or selling our product.  |
| Work as a team   | We welcome and support contributions from across our company and community and respect diverse perspectives. We create content processes that enable anyone to contribute in a meaningful way while reserving the right to disagree and commit.        |
| High agency   | We meet our deadlines and communicate risks well in advance. All of our editorial processes are documented in the handbook and if something is broken, we fix it. Anyone can advocate for their content idea by writing a pitch or proposal.     |
| High quality   | All public-facing content requires an editorial review (peer and/or editor depending on the content type) and adheres to our internal approval processes. We promise to keep content and editorial processes agile and low friction. We reserve the right to pull content that does not meet our documented brand standards.   |
| Be a good human   | Our content is rooted in empathy for our audiences. We strive to be relatable and show care for the people we speak to. We never engage in slander or defamation of another person, product, company, or service.    |
| Open and transparent  | Our content strategies, plans, and tactics are open and accessible to everyone in the company. We create editorial processes that make it easy to see and understand what content is planned, in progress, published, and how it’s performing.    |
| Continuously grow   | We actively solicit feedback and use data to improve the quality of our content. We experiment with new content ideas by writing proposals and reporting on our findings.   |

## Content sourcing

### `#newsroom` channel

The #newsroom channel is for team members to surface new story ideas to the content team. Anyone is welcome to join and can share links to news, opinion, discussions, or Sourcegraph product developments that could be worth pursuing as a blog post, guide, quiz, web article, or another content format.

We know that team members often share interesting news or industry trends in other channels. The point of #newsroom is to help the content team to aggregate and curate items that have potential to be a strong piece of content. The content can be anything that's relevant to our audience.

#### How to contribute ideas

Team members can post in the #newsroom channel as they think of things, or participate in the channel's weekly Geekbot prompts. Feel free to suggest edits to the Geekbot questions.

- The channel does not replace [pitching to the blog](#guidelines-for-contributing-to-sourcegraph-s-blog). Team members can still fill out the Asana form to pitch a blog post if you want to write about something, and there's no requirement to post in the #newsroom channel. The channel is for more informal sharing of possible ideas.
- It's up to the sharer to decide if you would like to write the content or if you're just offering the idea to the content team.
- We won't be able to turn all ideas into content. In some cases an idea may be more suitable for another publishing outlet, or it may spark an idea for related content. We want to embody our value of [high quality](../../company/values.md#high-quality) in all our content. To publish only the very best ideas, we need a lot of ideas to choose from! Anything you contribute adds to the pool of ideas and helps us to live this value. 

#### Soliciting feedback

We may also use #newsroom to solicit feedback from channel members on recently published content.
