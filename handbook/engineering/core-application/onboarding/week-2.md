## Activities

You completed your first week - great job! The first week is always a whirlwind of documents and tasks, so this week we will calm things down a bit and provide you with deeper focus.

Here's where you'll spend your time in week 2:

- **Pair with your buddy on your work:** Your onboarding buddy will pair with you on one or more tasks from our [JIRA board](https://sourcegraph.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5&projectKey=COREAPP). These will be tasks that we've previously evaluated as being good for new hires to tackle (and ship to production!)
- **Take a service tour:** We've created [service tours](index.md#service-tours) for important services that we interact with regularly. Choose one of them, use the links in the supporting documentation to explore the code, and then discuss what you learned with your onboarding buddy.

## Outcomes

At the end of the week, you'll have achieved the following outcomes:

1. You'll have shipped a feature or fix to production yourself.
2. You'll have gained a deeper knowledge of one of our services.
3. You'll understand how to use Sourcegraph itself to tackle work efficiently.
