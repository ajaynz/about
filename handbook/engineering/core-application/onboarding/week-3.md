## Activities

You're halfway done with your first month at Sourcegraph! Time flies, doesn't it? This week is about building further proficiency with the core application stack.

Here's where you'll spend your time in week 3:

- **Pair with a different team member on their work:** Previously you'd paired with your onboarding buddy, both for their work and yours. Set up time with a different core application team member and help them with something they're currently working on. Ask plenty of questions to understand how things fit together (and why).
- **Participate in iteration planning:** Now that you have some hands-on experience with the Sourcegraph project, help us plan and estimate the upcoming iteration. Don't worry about pinpoint accuracy - we want to hear your voice and your contributions, and we'll help guide you.
- **Take further service tours:** Last week, you took one of our [service tours](index.md#service-tours) and discussed what you learned with your onboarding buddy. Select a different one and do the same thing this week. Additionally, relate this service tour to the previous one - how / why do these services connect, what data is being operated upon, etc.

## Outcomes

At the end of the week, you'll have achieved the following outcomes:

1. You'll have worked closely with multiple core application team members.
1. You'll have influenced the upcoming iteration, and helped us define where we go next.
1. You'll be able to more deeply discuss our services and their interactions.
